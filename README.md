attempts = 0

while True:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    attempts += 1

    if guess > number:
        print("Too high!")
    elif guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print(f"Correct! You guessed in {attempts} attempts.")
        break
```

---

# 📘 Day 3 – Python Learning Journey 🚀

## 📌 Overview

On Day 3, I focused on **advanced Python concepts** like:

* Lambda functions
* List comprehensions
* Functional programming (`map`, `filter`)
* Exception handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`)

I also built a **Calculator Project with Error Handling** to apply these concepts practically.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

### 🔹 1. Lambda Functions

* Learned how to write **anonymous one-line functions**
* Used for short, simple operations

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
```

---

### 🔹 2. List Comprehension

* Created lists in a **clean and efficient way**
* Added conditions inside list creation

```python
[x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

---

### 🔹 3. map() and filter()

* `map()` → Apply function to all elements
* `filter()` → Select elements based on condition

```python
list(map(lambda x: x*2, [1,2,3]))
list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, [1,2,3,4]))
```

---

### 🔹 4. Exception Handling

* Used `try` and `except` to handle runtime errors
* Learned different exception types:

  * `ValueError`
  * `ZeroDivisionError`
  * `TypeError`

```python
try:
    x = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
```

---

### 🔹 5. finally Block

* Executes **always**, whether error occurs or not

```python
finally:
    print("Execution completed")
```

---

### 🔹 6. raise Keyword

* Manually triggered exceptions for validation
* Enforced custom rules in program

```python
if op not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
    raise ValueError("Invalid operation")
```

---

## 💻 Mini Project: Calculator with Error Handling

### ✅ Features:

* Performs basic operations (+, -, *, /)
* Handles invalid inputs
* Prevents division by zero
* Uses `raise` for validation

---

## 🔥 Key Takeaways

* Python supports **functional programming** with lambda, map, filter
* List comprehensions are **more Pythonic and readable**
* Exception handling is essential for **robust applications**
* `raise` helps enforce **custom validation rules**

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add loop for continuous calculations
* Build GUI calculator (Tkinter)
* Store calculation history
* Convert into web app (Flask / MERN)

# 📘 Day 4 – Python Learning Journey

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 🔹 List Comprehension

* Learned how to write concise and efficient loops using list comprehension.
* Practiced filtering and transforming data in a single line.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
```

---

### 🔹 Dictionary Comprehension

* Understood how to create dictionaries dynamically.
* Applied conditions while building dictionaries.

```python
students = {"hareesh": 43, "arjun": 90, "rahul": 35}

failed_students = {name: marks for name, marks in students.items() if marks < 50}
```

---

### 🔹 Working with Dictionaries

* Accessed keys, values, and items
* Iterated using `.items()`
* Learned key-value mapping clearly

```python
for name, marks in students.items():
    print(name, marks)
```

---

### 🔹 Problem Solving Practice

✔ Stored student names and marks in a dictionary
✔ Calculated average marks
✔ Found topper using `max()`
✔ Filtered failed students
✔ Printed a formatted report

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Difference between **list vs dictionary structures**
* Importance of **structured data**
* How **comprehensions simplify code**
* Avoiding variable naming mistakes (`mark` vs `marks`)

---

## 💡 Challenges Faced

* Confusion between dictionary and list of dictionaries
* Variable naming errors in comprehensions
* Understanding how `.items()` works

---

## 🎯 Outcome

* Improved understanding of **Python data structures**
* Gained confidence in solving **real-world problems**
* Started thinking in a more **optimized and structured way**

---

* Practice problems using functions
* More problem-solving (LeetCode / HackerRank)

---

## 📌 Status

✅ Completed Day 4 successfully
📈 Progressing consistently in Python & problem solving
